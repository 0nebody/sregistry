# Setup

By the time you get here, you have added all required secrets and settings to your [settings](https://github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/tree/master/shub/settings) folder, and you've built and started the image. Next, you should navigate to [http://127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1) (localhost) to make sure the registry server is up and running. 

 1. [Interact](/sregistry/setup-interact) with your images, an essential step to controlling and using it.
 2. [User Roles](/sregistry/setup-roles) to give you control over who can create and access images.
 3. [Teams](/sregistry/setup-teams) of users can be created to give group level access to image collections.
 4. [Registration](/sregistry/setup-registration) of your registry so others can easily find it.
