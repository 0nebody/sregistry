# Installation

Installation will consist of the following steps:

 1. [Install host Dependencies](/sregistry/install-host) including Docker and compose to run the application.
 2. [Configure Settings](/sregistry/install-settings) to customize your installation.
 3. [Web Server and Storage](/sregistry/install-server) configuration based on your host needs.
 4. [Containers](/sregistry/install-containers) are ready to be started!

When you are done with this guide, you will have a running server! You can then move on to the [setup](/sregistry/setup) guide to better understand how to interact with your fresh Singularity Registry.
