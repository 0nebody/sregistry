## Settings
The most important control panel for your collections is the Settings page. You can access it via the "Settings" button at the top of the collection view.

### Badges
Recently added, you can get a badge to link to your collection

### Users
You might want to give other users control of your collection (to push and pull and generally manage), and these are called **owners**. You might also want to give some users pull access, most relevant if your collection is private. You can do that in the "Contributors" tab of the settings page:

### Danger Zone
And of course if you need to delete, the settings page has a Danger Zone. Be careful!
