# Singularity Registry Documentation

Hello there! It's so great that you want to use Singularity Registry. Let's get started. 

## Use a Registry

 - [sregistry Client](client.md): A client provided by Singularity Python to push, pull, list, and delete.
 - [Singularity usage](singularity-cliend.md): The Singularity development branch has functionality to use your registry too.

## Deploy a Registry

 - [introduction](introduction.md): Covers some background and basic information.
 - [deployment](deployment.md): will cover installing dependencies, configuring the web server, setting up variables and paths to the file system, and starting the application.
 - [setup](setup.md): setting up the running application, including user accounts and application registration.
 - [client](client.md): how to interact with your registry to push and pull images.

@vsoch wants [your input!](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues) This registry is driven by desire and need for clusters small and large, so if you don't tell me what you want, how will I know that you want it?
