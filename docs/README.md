# Singularity Registry Documentation

Hello there! It's so great that you want to use Singularity Registry. Let's get started. 

## Use a Registry

 - [sregistry Client](client.md): A client provided by Singularity Python to push, pull, list, and delete.

## Deploy a Registry

 - [introduction](introduction.md): Coverts some background and basic information.
 - [deployment](deployment.md): will cover installing dependencies, configuring the web server, setting up variables and paths to the file system, and starting the application.
 - [configuration](): covers how to create an admin ("super user") and register the application.
 - [api](): some basics about the api. Most of this usage documentation will live with the client, provided by [singularity-python](https://www.github.com/singularityware/singularity-python).

@vsoch wants [your input!](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/sregistry/issues) This registry is driven by desire and need for clusters small and large, so if you don't tell me what you want, how will I know that you want it?
