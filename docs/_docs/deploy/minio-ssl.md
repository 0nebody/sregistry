# Minio with SSL

This guide will help you to set up Minio with SSL, as detailed in the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/minio/minio/tree/master/docs/config). If you haven't already, you should have setup basic (http) Minio Storage via [the storage documentation here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/install/server#storage). Many setups are different, so it is possible that yours might vary from this. This guide is provided
as an example to help you during this process.
