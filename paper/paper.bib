  abstract  = "Here we present Singularity, software developed to bring
               containers and reproducibility to scientific computing. Using
               Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible
               environments of their choosing and design, and these complete
               environments can easily be copied and executed on other
               platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that
               harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and
               researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common
               workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case,
               Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC
               centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute
               software and compute environments. This ability to create and
               deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a
               previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing
               development for computational science.",

  abstract    = "Linux container technologies, as represented by Docker,
                 provide an alternative to complex and time-consuming
                 installation processes needed for scientiﬁc software. The ease
                 of deployment and the process isolation they enable, as well
                 as the reproducibility they permit across environments and
                 versions, are among the qualities that make them interesting
                 candidates for the construction of bioinformatic
                 infrastructures, at any scale from single workstations to high
                 throughput computing architectures. The Docker Hub is a public
                 registry which can be used to distribute bioinformatic
                 software as Docker images. However, its lack of curation and
                 its genericity make it difﬁcult for a bioinformatics user to
                 ﬁnd the most appropriate images needed. BioShaDock is a
                 bioinformatics-focused Docker registry, which provides a local
                 and fully controlled environment to build and publish
                 bioinformatic software as portable Docker images. It provides
                 a number of improvements over the base Docker registry on
                 authentication and permissions management, that enable its
                 integration in existing bioinformatic infrastructures such as
                 computing platforms. The metadata associated with the
                 registered images are domain-centric, including for instance
                 concepts deﬁned in the EDAM ontology, a shared and structured
                 vocabulary of commonly used terms in bioinformatics. The
                 registry also includes user deﬁned tags to facilitate its
                 discovery, as well as a link to the tool description in the
                 ELIXIR registry if it already exists. If it does not, the
                 BioShaDock registry will synchronize with the registry to
                 create a new description in the Elixir registry, based on the
                 BioShaDock entry metadata. This link will help users get more
                 information on the tool such as its EDAM operations, input and
                 output types. This allows integration with the ELIXIR Tools
                 and Data Services Registry, thus providing the appropriate
                 visibility of such images to the bioinformatics community.",
